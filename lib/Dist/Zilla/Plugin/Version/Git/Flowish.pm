# ABSTRACT: Get a version number via git and a flow-inspired structure.

    'Dist::Zilla::Role::VersionProvider',
    'Dist::Zilla::Role::TextTemplate'
);

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # [Version::Git::Flowish]
    # master_regexp = ^master$
    # release_regexp = ^release-(\d+.\d+\.\d+)$
    # tag_regexp = ^(\d.\d+\.\d+)$

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin consumes the Dist::Zilla VersionProvider role and gleans a version
number from Git using a structure similar to Vincent Driessen's
L<git flow|http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/> model.

The idea is to facilitate automated systems, such as continuous integration,
to divine version numbers from the branching and release strategies used in
our repositories.

Note that, by default, the version numbers used as defaults by this plugin
are in the form of C<0.0.0>.  This can be changed by manipulating the options
shown in the Synopsis.

It works like this:

=head2 Environment Variable #1

The environment variable FLOWISH_VERSION is checked and used if set.

=head2 Branch

The current branch is attained via a call to git granch and grepping for
the leading *.

    git branch --no-color 2> /dev/null

=head2 Case: Master Branch

If the current branch is master, then the most recent tag is attained
via:

    git describe --tags --abbrev=0
    
You can influence how this date is parsed using the C<tag_regexp> option.

=head2 Case: Release Branch

If this isn't the master branch, but it begins with "release-" (configurable
via C<master_regexp>) then the version number after the release- will be used.

=head2 Environment Variable #2

The environment variable FLOWISH_EXTRA_VERSION is checked and appending to the
version with a hyphen as a separator.  This lets you create development
versions of whathaveyou.

=head2 And Then?

At this point we just give up and return nothing.
